## Introduction

Bits are the building blocks of all digital data. Understanding bits and bitwise operations is crucial for anyone interested in computer science, programming, and digital electronics. This repository covers the basics and advanced concepts related to bits, including their representation, manipulation, and practical applications.

## What is a Bit?

A bit is the most basic unit of information in computing, representing a binary state: 0 or 1. Bits are the foundation of all data processing in computers.

### Key Points:
- **Bit**: Short for binary digit, can be 0 or 1.
- **Byte**: A group of 8 bits, commonly used to represent a character.

## Binary Numbers

Binary numbers are the base-2 numeral system used in digital electronics. They consist of only two digits, 0 and 1.

### Example Conversion:
- Decimal 5 -> Binary 0101
- Decimal 10 -> Binary 1010

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on bits and are crucial for low-level programming. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

### AND Operator (`&`)

**Operation**: Sets each bit to 1 if both corresponding bits are 1.

**Example**:
```
  5  ->  0101
  3  ->  0011
  ------------
AND   ->  0001 (1 in decimal)
```

### OR Operator (`|`)

**Operation**: Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.

**Example**:
```
  5  ->  0101
  3  ->  0011
  ------------
OR    ->  0111 (7 in decimal)
```

### XOR Operator (`^`)

**Operation**: Sets each bit to 1 if the corresponding bits are different.

**Example**:
```
  5  ->  0101
  3  ->  0011
  ------------
XOR   ->  0110 (6 in decimal)
```

### NOT Operator (`~`)

**Operation**: Inverts all bits.

**Example**:
```
  5  ->  0101
  -----------
NOT   ->  1010 (-6 in decimal)
```

## Applications of Bitwise Operations

Bitwise operations are used in various applications, such as:

- **Setting and Clearing Flags**
- **Efficient Computation**
- **Cryptography**
- **Network Programming**

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Finding the Unique Element
**Problem**: Find the element that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice.

**Solution**:
```python
def find_unique(arr):
    unique = 0
    for num in arr:
        unique ^= num
    return unique
```

### Toggling Bits
**Problem**: Toggle a specific bit in a number.

**Solution**:
```python
def toggle_bit(n, k):
    return n ^ (1 << k)
```
